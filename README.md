# pentesting-glitter
Glitter app simulates a social network nowadays
This project was divided into two parts.
In the first part, my goal was to pentesting the application and find the weaknesses within the social network.
the second part was diveded into two parts: the first was contact the app server in Python and implement the weaknesses we found in Part A through code.
the second part was to build a user interface in which he will be presented with the weaknesses found and behind the scenes of the interface will be the realization of the weaknesses we have made in the first part and imported as a library in Python.
